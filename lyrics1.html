        Lyrics
        Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
        I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
        Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
        But I hope I never see them again
        I know it breaks your heart
        Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
        Four years, no calls
        Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
        And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
        No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
        So, baby, pull me closer
        In the back seat of your Rover
        That I know you can't afford
        Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
        Pull the sheets right off the corner
        Of that mattress that you stole
        From your roommate back in Boulder
        We ain't ever getting older
        We ain't ever getting older
        We ain't ever getting older
        You look as good as the day I met you
        I forget just why I left you, I was insane
        Stay and play that Blink-182 song
        That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
        I know it breaks your heart
        Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
        Four years, no call
        Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
        And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
        No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
        So, baby, pull me closer
        In the back seat of your Rover
        That I know you can't afford
        Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
        Pull the sheets right off the corner
        Of that mattress that you stole
        From your roommate back in Boulder
        We ain't ever getting older
        We ain't ever getting older
        We ain't ever getting older
